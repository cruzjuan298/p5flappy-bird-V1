# p5flappy-bird-V1

A recreation of Flappy Bird using the p5 JavaScript library.

## Introduction

Built with the p5 library for the All Star Code Week 4 Group project, this game's objective is to guide the bird past the tubes, similar to Flappy Bird. The primary goal is to maneuver Flappy under the tubes without touching them, accomplished by pressing the spacebar key.

## Key Notes

The scoring system has not been updated yet. I am currently working on changing it so that each time the bird passes through a tube, a point is scored for the player. Once the player touches a tube, the game resets. The tube system will also change, introducing multiple tubes appearing on the screen.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript (p5 library), HTML, CSS
